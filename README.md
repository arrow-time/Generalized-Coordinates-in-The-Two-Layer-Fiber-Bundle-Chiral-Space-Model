# Generalized Coordinates in The Two Layer Fiber Bundle Chiral Space Model

13.4 Generalized Coordinates in This Model：
Preliminary Discussion on the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian Analytical Mechanics Framework Based on This Model:
In the topologically homeomorphic space field of this quantized elastic spacetime model, each SEQ (Space Elementary Quantum) has a fixed spatial coordinate and fixed adjacency relations. The generalized coordinates of each SEQ are its resonance frequency and resonance axis vector(ωᵢ，n̂(i)). These two quantities, combined with the dynamic structural matrix of matter, can generate physical quantities such as mass, momentum, velocity, acceleration, force, kinetic energy, and potential energy—all expressed as polynomials of the generalized coordinates or their differentials (partial derivatives or integrals). Based on this framework, conservation equations can be constructed.

13.5 Under the topologically homeomorphic setting, the spatial coordinates of each SEQ serve as its structural label and constitute important topological invariants. These coordinates remain fixed during dynamical evolution (i.e., they do not change over time), and therefore are not subjected to time differentiation. Nevertheless, they play a crucial role in constructing conservation equations, such as defining local gradients and adjacency relations. Hence, they should be regarded as background structural parameters rather than components of generalized coordinates.

13.6 Mass, Mass represents a spatial compression state that cannot be characterized by a single SEQ. Instead, it requires a local description in terms of the local spatial compression rate — the degree of deformation, which can be quantitatively expressed as the average frequency shift within that local space. Frequency directly reflects the extent of spatial deformation.

Since this model does not incorporate the conventional concept of volume, the notion of compression is inherently tied to the topologically homeomorphic SEQ network. Whether compressed or not, the structure remains a SEQ grid, and thus, spatial compression must be described through either:

A general relativistic tensor representation of the compression rate, or

The average resonance frequency of the SEQs contained within the mass-bearing object, which captures the spatial deformation effect.

Therefore, mass can be effectively represented by the number of SEQs within the object and their collective resonance frequency. This leads to the following formulation:

m = K×N×(ωₚ/ω̄)

Where:
m: mass

K: a dimensional conversion constant (can be dimensionless or carry traditional mass dimensions)

N: number of SEQs contained in the mass-bearing object

ω̄ : average resonance frequency (relative to Planck frequency shift)

ωₚ : Planck frequency

(ωₚ/ω̄): represents the degree of spatial deformation

13.7 Force — next, we discuss F = ma. Acceleration can be understood as the rate of change of spatial deformation gradient between a mass-bearing object and its external environment. This gradient of deformation induces the object to maintain structural synchronization during acceleration, resulting in additional spatial deformation — compression at the front end of acceleration and stretching at the back end. In this framework, m represents the structural response barrier (mass), and F is the deformation action required to induce an additional gradient of spatial deformation in an object of mass m. The essence of F = m a is: in order to cause a change in the spatial deformation gradient (acceleration) of an object that possesses a structural response barrier (mass), a corresponding deformation action (force) must be applied.

13.8 Other conceptual constructions of classical physical quantities — the following are only examples and not strict mathematical formalizations:
Starting from the perspective of spatial deformation — local frequency duality, we define the phase φ = Δω / ω₀, where Δω is the local frequency shift and ω₀ is the reference frequency. From this, we construct the wave vector k = ∇φ. Then, we define momentum of generalized coordinate-SEQ Frequency as p = ħk, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant, ħ = h / (2π). 

The resonance frequency and resonance axis vector of each SEQ — which are the generalized coordinates — correspond to two different sets of analytical expressions for generalized momentum. The generalized momentum of the SEQ resonance axis needs to be further developed in future work. According to this model, the direction of the SEQ resonance axis depends on the adjacency configuration, which is discrete and finite, thus making the direction quantized as well.

In the analytical expression of the generalized momentum of the SEQ resonance frequency as a generalized coordinate, the reduced Planck constant ħ is not used to characterize the quantization of angular momentum, but rather to describe phase quantization in the harmonic oscillation of SEQ (this is only a conceptual analysis tool — the actual phase variation may not necessarily be quantized). This allows for a formal description of the phase gradient between matter and its surrounding SEQ in the process of material wave formation.
Velocity is then defined as v = p / m, acceleration as a = dv / dt, force as F = dp / dt, and so on.

13.9 In this model, the spatial field is a topologically homeomorphic structural field, and the motion of matter corresponds to the propagation of excitation waves on this field. Therefore, when constructing conservation equations, they may differ from the traditional conservation equations in analytical mechanics, but they should be able to derive equivalent forms corresponding to the classical ones. Here, I can only propose a rough framework, and the specific rigorous mathematical formalization likely still requires the work of professional physicists to complete.

Although Einstein adopted the geometric description based on the metric tensor in his General Relativity, he had already noticed the significant influence of gravity on light frequency shifts. The 'Deformation-Frequency Equivalence Principle' proposed in this paper can be regarded as a continuation of this unification vision—it reinterprets the variation of spacetime tensor structure as a frequency modulation process of SEQ, thereby establishing a new unified descriptive paradigm between the microscopic and macroscopic scales.

Deriving a metric-quantum frequency function from cosmological gravitational redshift measurements and QCD-level interactions could establish a functional mapping-
(ω_QFT = f(g_μν)_GR) between GR's spacetime geometry and QFT's quantum observables, offering a mathematically tractable and empirically testable tool for unifying gravity and quantum theory.
