# -Generalized-Coordinates-in-The-Two-Layer-Fiber-Bundle-Chiral-Space-Model
In the topologically homeomorphic space field of this quantized elastic spacetime model, each SEQ (Space Elementary Quantum) has a fixed spatial coordinate and fixed adjacency relations. The generalized coordinates of each SEQ are its resonance frequency and resonance axis vector(ωᵢ，n̂(i)).
